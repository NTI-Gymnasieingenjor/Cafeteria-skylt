# Instructions for usage

## Introduction

#### Basics of booting up RaspberryPi.
The Pi's power cable uses a USB-C port so make sure it is connected to the electrical grid you are using.  
The Pi's micro-HDMI port also needs to be connected to a screen as to make sure the Pi's boot-up script goes accordingly.  

#### Basics of interface
To access the interface, press your 'âŠž Win' or homekey button.  
From here you can select three relevant categories (all listed below) of the Pi when making changes.  
| Preferences | Accessories | Logout |  

#### Basics of 'Preferences'
In 'Preferences' you will find 'Raspberry Pi Configuration'.  
In 'Raspberry Pi Configuration' you have: | System | Interfaces | Performance | Localisation |  

System is primarily for changing the username and password.  

Interfaces, in this example, is used for toggling VNC, which allows screen connect through other devices via IP.  

Performance has the selection of overclocking (*NOT RECOMMENDED*) and GPU memory,  
which may be adjusted accordingly in order to avoid overheating.  

Localisation allows you to set the Locale, Timezone, Keyboard and WiFi Country, not relevant in this example.  

#### Basics of 'Accessories'
In 'Accessories' you will find 'File Manager' and 'Terminal'.  
'File Manager' is where you access the 'Cafeteria-skylt' folder, which is located on the SD-card of this Pi.   
The folder location: '/home/pi/Git/Cafeteria-skylt'

'Terminal' is the command prompt of Pi, here you will use many useful commands.  
Some basic commands include:
- sudo raspi-config (opens up base configuration)
- cd <*path*> (changes directory)
- ls <*path*> (lists the directory)
- hostname -I (shows the IP-address of the Pi)

#### Basics of 'Logout'
'Logout' uses | Shutdown | Reboot | Logout |  
'Shutdown' shuts down the Pi, allowing you to safely pull the cable, or you can write 'sudo shutdown -h now' in 'Terminal'.  
'Reboot' reboots the Pi, or you can write 'sudo shutdown -r now' in 'Terminal'.  
'Logout' logs you out from the currently active user.
